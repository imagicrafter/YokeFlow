Copyright © 2025 MS4 INC
Maintained by the [Dynamous community](https://dynamous.ai)

YokeFlow is **free, open, and hackable.** Run it, fork it, and share it — no strings attached — except one: **don't sell it as-a-service without talking to us first.**

---

### 1  You Can

* **Run** YokeFlow anywhere, for anything, for free.
* **Study & tweak** the code, add features, change the UI—go wild.
* **Share** your changes or forks publicly (must keep this license in place).

### 2  Please Do

* Keep this license notice and a link back to the main repo.
* Mark clearly if you've modified YokeFlow.

### 3  You Can't (Without Permission)

* Charge money for YokeFlow itself—e.g. paid downloads, paywalled builds, or subscriptions.
* Offer YokeFlow (original or modified) as a hosted or managed service that others can sign up for.
* Bundle YokeFlow into another paid product.

> **Consulting/support is totally fine.** Get paid to install, customise, or teach YokeFlow as long as your clients don't get a hosted YokeFlow instance run by you.

### 4  No Warranty

YokeFlow comes **as-is** with **no warranty** of any kind.

### 5  Limitation of Liability

We're **not liable** for any damages resulting from using YokeFlow.

### 6  Breaking the Rules

If you violate these terms and don't fix it within **30 days** after we let you know, your rights under this license end.

## Additional Credits
